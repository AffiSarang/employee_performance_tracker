# employee_performance_tracker
Project description :
The Employee Performance Tracker is a Python-based application designed to record, manage, and analyze employee performance data in an organization. It helps the management team monitor productivity by storing details like employee name, department, hours worked, tasks completed, and performance rating.
This system uses CSV file handling to store data, applies functions and object-oriented programming (OOP) for structured coding, and uses matplotlib for visual representation of employee performance. It also identifies the Employee of the Month and allows exporting top performer data to a separate file.

How It Works:
The system displays a menu with various options.
Users can:
Add new employee details.
View all existing employees.
Analyze performance and find the top performer.
Visualize data using charts.
Export the best employee’s data into a new CSV file.
Data is stored and retrieved from a employees.csv file in the data folder.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x — Core programming language
CSV Module — For reading and writing data
Matplotlib — For generating performance charts
OOP Concepts — For defining employee objects and methods
File Handling — For managing employee records

How to Run the Project:
Open the project folder in VS Code or any Python IDE.
(Optional) Activate your virtual environment:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
Run the program using the command:
python -m src.main
Choose options from the interactive menu to manage employee data and visualize performance.
